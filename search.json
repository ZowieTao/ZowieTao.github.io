Color Mode SupportPrepare:Two sets of colorsTwo sets of colors, before starting work, we should known what the result is. Eg: projectBackground: (#ffffff, #000000), projectColor: (#000000, #ffffff)This means that when in light mode, the background is black and other content such as text is white, while in dark mode the opposite result. Color depth changeThe result of the color depth change allows us to get the correct effect in some hovering effects. Eg: Button background color is blue, and hovering we can get correct color by background color directly. This way we don’t need to additionally set the color of the suspension effect. If the effect is achieved directly through opacity, the color of the text will also change accordingly. So we need a way to get the result by passing the color and the opacity we want to change — hexWithOpacity.
