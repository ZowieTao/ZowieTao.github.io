Color Mode SupportPrepare:Two sets of colorsTwo sets of colors, before starting work, we should known what the result is. Eg: projectBackground: (#ffffff, #000000), projectColor: (#000000, #ffffff)This means that when in light mode, the background is black and other content such as text is white, while in dark mode the opposite result. Color depth changeThe result of the color depth change allows us to get the correct effect in some hovering effects. Eg: Button background color is blue, and hovering we can get correct color by background color directly. This way we don’t need to additionally set the color of the suspension effect. If the effect is achieved directly through opacity, the color of the text will also change accordingly. So we need a way to get the result by passing the color and the opacity we want to change — hexWithOpacity. API and MethodsMethod to change color mode and get the color of components.We can use ‘useColorModeValue’ to set a variable value , through which we can get the set color in different color modes. Although it looks like we are setting different colors in different color modes, in fact in this hooks we are getting the current color mode and returning the corresponding color result.Use toggleColorMode to toggle the global color mode.The useColorModeValue provided by chakra may cause additional performance overhead when fetching a large number of colors, because going back to the useColorMode hooks each time this hook is used may be more obvious when fetching a large number of colors. Steps:Set project initial color modeText Get(‘set’) color value by ‘useColorModeValue’ Use color value in different components and toggle color modeuse like: Other:Hex with opacity use condition Referance chakra-ui | color mode "}]
